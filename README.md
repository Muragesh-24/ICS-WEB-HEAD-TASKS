## ðŸ’¡ Note

I completed these tasks while recovering from an injury (with a pop bandage on my hand). Due to time constraints, I used a few templates and AI tools for repetitive tasks, but ensured every element aligns with the core objectives and standards expected by ICS. I focused on building functional, user-friendly projects that reflect my commitment and design thinking.
